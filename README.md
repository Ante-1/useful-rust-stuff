## Crates

### Crate indexes

- https://lib.rs/ - Fast, lightweight, opinionated, unofficial alternative to crates.io

### Crates I used at least a bit or want to try

- rand - random number generator
- anyhow - error handling
- clap - command-line argument parser/helper
- serde - parsing eg. JSON
- reqwest - simple higher-level HTTP client
- indicatif - terminal progress bars
- log - logging with levels and writing not only to terminal but eg. to a logging server
- env_logger - based on log, configured with ENV vars
- tokio - async runtime
- actix-web - web server(framework), includes WebSockets
- yew - Frontend/GUI framework, component-based, react-like, based on WASM
