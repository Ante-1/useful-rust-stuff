# Useful Rust Stuff

## Crates

### Crate indexes

- https://lib.rs/ - Fast, lightweight, opinionated, unofficial alternative to crates.io
- https://crates.io/ - official crate library

### Crates I used at least a bit or want to try

- rand - random number generator
- anyhow - error handling
- clap - command-line argument parser/helper
- serde - serializing/deserializing eg. JSON
- reqwest - simple higher-level HTTP client
- indicatif - terminal progress bars
- log - logging with levels and writing not only to terminal but eg. to a logging server
- env_logger - based on log, configured with ENV vars
- tokio - async runtime
- actix-web - web server(framework), includes WebSockets
- yew - Frontend/GUI framework, component-based, react-like, based on WASM
- unicode-segmentation - Grapheme Cluster, Word and Sentence boundaries
- regex - Regular Expressions
- chrono - dates and times

## Learning

### Books
